# Basic_CRD_Operations

Before going through the doc we need to see that what basically thread is? 

So, A <a href="https://realpython.com/intro-to-python-threading/">Thread</a> is a separate flow of execution. This means that your program will have two things happening at once. But for most Python 3 implementations the different threads do not actually execute at the same time

Points we are trying to achieve:
<li>A new key-value pair can be added to the data store using the Create operation.The key is always a string-capped at 32chars
<li>Delete operation is performed by providing the key
<li>file storing data must never exceed 1GB
<li>Unit test cases for testing our Code
<li>Thread safe
